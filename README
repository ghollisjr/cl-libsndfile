cl-libsndfile is a common lisp binding for libsndfile, the legendary
library for opening audio files in a generally useful way without
having to care so much about the file format details.

This project has two layers: Direct C interface using cffi, and a Lisp
friendly interface where you can use lists, vectors, Lisp numerical
types, etc. instead of worrying so much about specific data types.
One's good for efficiency; the other's good for everything else.
